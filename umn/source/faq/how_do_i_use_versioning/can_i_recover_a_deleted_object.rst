Can I Recover a Deleted Object?
===============================

When versioning is enabled, if you delete an object without specifying a version ID, the object is tagged with a delete marker and displayed in the list of **Deleted Objects**. You can recover the object from that list.

If you delete an object with a version ID specified when versioning is enabled or you delete an object when versioning is not enabled, OBS permanently deletes the object, and you cannot recover it.

For details, see :ref:`Versioning Overview <en-us_topic_0045853504>`.
