Background Running
==================

**Scenarios**

There are lots of tasks running on OBS Browser+, but you want to close it and perform other operations while the tasks continue in the background.

**How do my tasks enter and end the background running mode?**

To enter background running mode, click the close icon in the upper right corner of OBS Browser+ and select **Background Running** in the **Exit OBS Browser+** dialog box. Then, all your tasks will run in the background.

To end background running mode, double-click the OBS Browser+ icon in the task bar to display its interface again.
