How Much Data Can I Store in OBS?
=================================

There are no restrictions on the total capacity or number of objects or files that can be stored by the OBS system or in any single bucket. However, there are limitations on what you can upload to your bucket at a time.

-  If you use OBS Browser, an API, or an SDK, you can upload a single object of up to 48.8 TB.
