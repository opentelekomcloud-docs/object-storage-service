Parallel File System
====================

OBS Parallel File System (PFS), a sub-product of OBS, is a high-performance file system, with only milliseconds of access latency in the case of suitable networking and computing packages. OBS PFS can support a huge bandwidth and handle a huge amount of IOPS on the storage side, making it ideal for processing high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.

For details about PFS, see the `Parallel File System Feature Guide <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/object-storage-service/parallel-file-system/>`__.
