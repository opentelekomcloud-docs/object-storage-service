#. In the navigation pane on the left, click **Permissions** to go to the permission management page.

#. On the **Bucket Policies** tab page, select a policy from the **Standard Bucket Policies** area.

   -  **Private**: No access beyond the bucket ACL settings is granted.
   -  **Public Read**: Any user can read objects in the bucket.
   -  **Public Read and Write**: Any user can read, write, and delete objects in the bucket.

   .. note::

      For your data security, the **Public Read** and **Public Read and Write** policies are not recommended.
