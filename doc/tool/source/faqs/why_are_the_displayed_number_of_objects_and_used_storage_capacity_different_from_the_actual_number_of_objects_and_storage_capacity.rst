Why Are the Displayed Number of Objects and Used Storage Capacity Different from the Actual Number of Objects and Storage Capacity?
===================================================================================================================================

Possible causes are as follows:

-  The statistics are not collected in real time and there is a delay.
-  The statistics are estimates only.

The number of objects and used storage capacity displayed on OBS Browser+ are for reference only.
