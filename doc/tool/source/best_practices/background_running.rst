Background Running
==================

If there are lots of tasks running on OBS Browser+, but you want to perform other operations outside OBS Browser+, you can close OBS Browser+ while tasks are still running in the background. Specifically, click the close icon in the upper right corner of OBS Browser+ and select **Background Running** in the **Exit OBS Browser+** dialog box. Then, all your tasks will run in the background. You can also double-click the OBS Browser+ icon in the task bar to display its interface again.
