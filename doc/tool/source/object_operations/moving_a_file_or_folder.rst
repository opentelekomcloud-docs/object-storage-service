Moving a File or Folder
=======================

Move a file or folder stored in OBS from one path to another path.

.. important::

   -  Files or folders in external buckets cannot be moved.
   -  The source path and target path must be different.
   -  If a task is manually canceled or interrupted unexpectedly due to network problems, the task cannot be automatically resumed or continued. In this case, the source object (not deleted) and the target object (copied) may coexist.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to OBS Browser+.
#. Go to the target bucket. Right-click the file or folder and choose **Move** from the shortcut menu.
#. Right-click the path for saving the file or folder and choose **Paste** from the shortcut menu.
