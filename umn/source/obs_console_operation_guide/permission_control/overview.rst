Overview
========

OBS supports the following permission control mechanisms:

-  IAM policies: IAM policies define the actions that can be performed on your cloud resources. In other words, IAM policies specify what actions are allowed or denied.

-  Bucket policies and object policies:

   A bucket policy applies to the configured bucket and objects in the bucket. A bucket owner can use a bucket policy to grant permissions of buckets and objects in the buckets to IAM users or other accounts.

   An object policy applies to specified objects in a bucket.

-  Access control lists (ACLs): Control the read and write permissions for accounts. You can set ACLs for buckets and objects.
