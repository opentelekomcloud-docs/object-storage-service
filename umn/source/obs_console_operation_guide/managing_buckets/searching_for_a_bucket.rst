Searching for a Bucket
======================

You can search for a bucket by characters contained in its name.

.. note::

   Currently, searching for buckets by tag is not supported.

Procedure
---------

#. In the search box at the upper right corner of the OBS Console homepage, enter characters contained in the name of the bucket that you want to search for.

#. Click |image1|.

   Buckets that meet the search criteria are displayed in the bucket list.

   For example, if you want to search for buckets whose names contain **test**, you only need to enter **test** in the search box and click |image2|. Then, all buckets that contain **test** in their names are displayed.
