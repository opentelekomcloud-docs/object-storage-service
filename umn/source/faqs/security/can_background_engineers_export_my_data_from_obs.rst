Can Background Engineers Export My Data from OBS?
=================================================

No. Background engineers cannot export your data. For example, if a bucket or an object is undisclosed when you access the bucket or object, only the owner of the bucket or object can access it. Further, the access to the bucket or object requires access keys (AK/SK).
