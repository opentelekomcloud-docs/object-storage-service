DELETE Bucket Encryption
========================

OBS uses the DELETE method to delete the encryption configuration of a specified bucket.

To perform this operation, you must have the **s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration** permission. By default, only the bucket owner can delete the tags of a bucket. The bucket owner can allow other users to perform this operation by setting a bucket policy or granting them the permission.
