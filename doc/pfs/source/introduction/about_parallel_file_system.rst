About Parallel File System
==========================

Parallel File System (PFS), a sub-product of OBS, is a high-performance file system, with only milliseconds of access latency. PFS can support terabytes of bandwidth and can handle millions of IOPS, which makes it ideal for processing high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.

You can access data in a parallel file system using standard OBS APIs.
