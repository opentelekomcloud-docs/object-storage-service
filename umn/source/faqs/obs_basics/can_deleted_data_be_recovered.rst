Can Deleted Data Be Recovered?
==============================

-  If versioning is enabled for a bucket, deleted objects are saved to the **Deleted Objects** list. You can recover objects from the **Deleted Objects** list. For details, see :ref:`Undeleting a File <en-us_topic_0066176932>`.
-  If versioning is not enabled, deleted objects cannot be recovered.
