Configuring Access Logging for a Bucket
=======================================

After logging is enabled for a bucket, OBS automatically converts bucket logs into objects following the naming rules and writes the objects into a target bucket.

Procedure
---------

#. In the bucket list, click the bucket you want to operate to go to the **Objects** page.

#. In the navigation pane, choose **Overview**.

#. In the **Basic Configurations** area, click **Logging**. The **Logging** dialog box is displayed.

#. Select **Enable**.

#. Select an existing bucket where you want to store log files. Log delivery users of the selected bucket will be automatically granted the permissions to read the bucket ACL and write logs to the bucket.

#. Enter a prefix for the **Log File Name Prefix**.

   After logging is enabled, generated logs are named in the following format:

   *<Log File Name Prefix>YYYY-mm-DD-HH-MM-SS*\ **-**\ *<UniqueString>*

   -  *<Log File Name Prefix>* is the shared prefix of log file names.
   -  *YYYY-mm-DD-HH-MM-SS* indicates the UTC time when the log was created.
   -  *<UniqueString>* indicates a character string generated by OBS.

   On OBS Console, if the configured *<Log File Name Prefix>* ends with a slash (/), logs generated in the bucket are stored in the *<Log File Name Prefix>* folder in the bucket, facilitating the management of log files.

   Example:

   -  If the bucket named **bucket** is used to save log files, and the log file name prefix is set to **bucket-log/**, all log files delivered to this bucket are saved in the **bucket-log** folder. A log file is named as follows: **2015-06-29-12-22-07-N7MXLAF1BDG7MPDV**.
   -  If the bucket named **bucket** is used to save log files, and the log file name prefix is set to **bucket-log**, all log files are saved in the root directory of the bucket. A log file is named as follows: **bucket-log2015-06-29-12-22-07-N7MXLAF1BDG7MPDV**.

#. Click **OK**.

   After logging is configured, you can view operation logs in the bucket that stores the logs in approximately fifteen minutes.

If you do not need to record logs, in the **Logging** dialog box, select **Disable** and then click **OK**. After logging is disabled, logs are not recorded, but existing logs in the target bucket will be retained.
