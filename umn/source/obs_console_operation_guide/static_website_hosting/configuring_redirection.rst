Configuring Redirection
=======================

You can redirect all requests for a bucket to another bucket or URL by configuring redirection rules.

Prerequisites
-------------

Web page files required for static website hosting have been uploaded to the specified bucket.

The static website files hosted in the bucket are accessible to anonymous users.

Static web page files in the Cold storage class have been restored. For more information, see :ref:`Restoring an Object from Cold Storage <obs_03_0320>`.

Procedure
---------

#. In the bucket list, click the bucket you want to operate. The **Overview** page is displayed.

#. In the **Basic Configurations** area, click **Static Website Hosting**. The **Static Website Hosting** page is displayed.

   Alternatively, you can choose **Basic Configurations** > **Static Website Hosting** from the navigation pane on the left.

#. Click **Configure Static Website Hosting**. The **Configure Static Website Hosting** dialog box is displayed.

#. Enable **Status**.

#. Set **Hosting By** to **Redirection**, as shown in :ref:`Figure 1 <en-us_topic_0066088957__fig965144815468>`. In the text box of **Redirect To**, enter the bucket's access domain name or URL.

#. Click **OK**.

#. In the bucket list, click the bucket to which requests for the static website are redirected.

#. (**Optional**) If the static website files in the bucket are not accessible to anonymous users, perform this step. If they are already accessible to everyone, skip this step.

   Grant the read permission for static website files to anonymous users. For details, see :ref:`Granting Anonymous Users Permission to Access Objects <obs_03_0132>`.

   If the bucket contains only static website files, configure the **Public Read** policy for the bucket so that all files in it are publicly accessible.

   a. Choose **Permissions** > **Bucket Policies**.

   b. In the **Standard Bucket Policies** area, select the **Public Read** policy for the bucket.

   c. Click **Public Read**. For details, see :ref:`Figure 2 <en-us_topic_0066088957__en-us_topic_0045853755_fig15186794193556>`. In the confirmation dialog box that is displayed, click **Yes**.
