What Can I Do with Tags?
========================

If you add tags to a bucket, service detail records (SDRs) generated for it will be labeled with these tags. You can classify SDRs by tag for cost analysis. For example, if you have an application that uploads its running data to a bucket, you can tag the bucket with the application name. In this manner, the costs on the application can be analyzed using tags in SDRs.
