Overview
========

If you have ACL permissions on buckets of other users, you can add them through OBS Browser+ as external buckets. By doing so, you can access these external buckets locally using your account.

By default, after user A has added a bucket of user B and uploaded an object to the bucket, user B cannot download the object.
