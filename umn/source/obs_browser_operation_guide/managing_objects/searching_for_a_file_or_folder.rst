Searching for a File or Folder
==============================

This section describes how to search for a file or folder by name prefix on OBS Browser.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to OBS Browser.

#. Click the bucket where the target file or folder resides.

#. In the search box above the object list, enter the name prefix of the file or folder that you want to search for.

   In the root directory of the bucket, files and folders whose name starts with the specified prefix are displayed.

   .. note::

      If you want to search for objects within a folder, you can use either of the following methods:

      -  In the search box of the root directory, enter *folder path*/*object name prefix*. For example, if you enter **abc/123/example**, all files and folders whose name is prefixed with **example** in the **abc/123** folder are displayed.
      -  Alternatively, you can open the specific folder, and enter the object name prefix in the search box of that folder. For example, you can open the **abc/123** folder and enter **example** in the search box. Then all files and folders whose name is prefixed with **example** in the **abc/123** folder are displayed.
