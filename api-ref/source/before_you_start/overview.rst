Overview
========

Welcome to the *Object Storage Service API Reference*. Object Storage Service (OBS) provides massive, secure, reliable, and cost-effective data storage capabilities for users to store data of any type and size. It is suitable for scenarios such as enterprise backup/archiving, video on demand (VoD), and video surveillance.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on OBS, such as creating, modifying, and deleting bucket, as well as uploading, downloading, and deleting objects. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <obs_04_0005>`.

Before calling OBS APIs, ensure that you have fully understood relevant concepts. For details, see :ref:`Basic Concepts <obs_04_0004>`.

OBS provides Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs that you can call by making HTTP or HTTPS requests. For details, see :ref:`Calling APIs <obs_04_0006>`.

Endpoints
---------

An endpoint is a **request address** for calling an API. Endpoints vary depending on services and regions. For the endpoints of all services, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/endpoint/index.html>`__.

OBS provides a different second-level domain name for each region. You can use the domain names provided by OBS or define your own domain names to access OBS.
