What Is the Relationship Between Bucket Storage Classes and Object Storage Classes?
===================================================================================

When an object is uploaded, it inherits the storage class of the bucket by default, but you can change the default storage class when you upload the object.

Changing the storage class of a bucket does not change the storage classes of existing objects in the bucket, but newly uploaded objects will inherit the new storage class.
