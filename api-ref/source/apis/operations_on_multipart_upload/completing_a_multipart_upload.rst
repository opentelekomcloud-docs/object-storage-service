Completing a Multipart Upload
=============================

Functions
---------

After all parts are uploaded, you can call this API to assemble specified parts into an object. Before performing this operation, you cannot download the uploaded data. When merging parts, you need to copy the additional message header information recorded during the initialization of the multipart upload task to the object metadata. The processing process is the same as that of the common upload object with these message headers. In the case of merging parts concurrently, the Last Write Win policy must be followed but the time for initiating Last Write is specified as the time when a part multipart upload is initiated.

As long as the multipart upload is not aborted, all uploaded parts occupy the space. However, after you assembled the specified parts, the uploaded but not assembled parts will be deleted to free up space.

You can send a request for downloading all or some data of the generated multipart by specifying a range.

You can send a request for deleting all parts uploaded in a multipart upload. Deleted data cannot be restored.

The merged parts do not use the MD5 value of entire object as the ETag. Their ETag is calculated as follows: *MD5(M\ 1\ M\ 2...M\ N)-N*, where *M\ n* is the MD5 value of part *n* (*N* is the total number of parts). As described in the :ref:`Sample Request <obs_04_0102__section74706439232>`, there are three parts and each part has an MD5 value. The MD5 values of the three parts are recalculated to obtain a new MD5 value. Then *-N* is added to the right of the MD5 value to get the ETag of the combined parts. In this example, *-N* is **-3**.

If the response to an object assembling request timed out and error 500 or 503 was returned, you can first obtain the object metadata of the multipart upload task. Then, check whether the value of header **x-obs-uploadId** in the response is the same as the ID of the current multipart upload task. If they are, it means the object parts have been successfully assembled on the server and you do not need to try again. For details, see :ref:`Consistency of Concurrent Operations <obs_04_0118>`.

WORM
----

If a bucket has WORM enabled, the WORM protection will be automatically applied to the object generated after a multipart upload is complete. If you specify WORM headers and a retention expiration date when you initiate a multipart upload, the protection for the assembled object ends on the specified date. If you do not specify WORM headers during the initiation, but have configured the default bucket-level retention policy, this default policy is automatically applied and the protection starts when the multipart upload is complete. After a multipart upload is complete, you can still configure object-level WORM retention policies for the assembled object.

Versioning
----------

If a bucket has versioning enabled, a unique version ID is generated for an object created from a multipart upload in this bucket and the version ID is returned in response header **x-obs-version-id**. If versioning is suspended for a bucket, the object version obtained after the merge is **null**. For details about the versioning statuses of a bucket, see :ref:`Configuring Versioning for a Bucket <obs_04_0037>`.

.. important::

   If 10 parts are uploaded but only nine parts are selected for merge, the parts that are not merged will be automatically deleted by the system. The parts that are not merged cannot be restored after being deleted. Before combining the parts, adopt the interface used to list the parts that have been uploaded to check all parts to ensure that no part is missed.
