Configuring URL Validation
==========================

OBS blocks access requests from blacklisted URLs and allows those from whitelisted URLs.

Prerequisites
-------------

Static website hosting has been enabled.

Procedure
---------

#. In the bucket list, click the bucket you want to operate. The **Overview** page is displayed.

#. In the right **Basic Configurations** area, click **URL Validation**. The **URL Validation** page is displayed.

#. Click |image1| next to the text box of **Whitelisted Referers** or **Blacklisted Referers**, and enter the referers.

   Principles for setting **Referers**:

   -  The length of a whitelist or blacklist cannot exceed 1024 characters.
   -  Referer format:

      -  You can enter multiple referers, each in a line.
      -  The referer parameter supports asterisks (*) and question marks (?). An asterisk works as a wildcard that can replace zero or multiple characters, and a question mark (?) can replace a single character.
      -  If the referer header field contains **http** or **https** during download, the referer must contain **http** or **https**.

   -  If **Whitelisted Referers** is left blank but **Blacklisted Referers** is not, all websites except those specified in the blacklist are allowed to access data in the target bucket.
   -  If **Whitelisted Referers** is not left blank, only the websites specified in the whitelist are allowed to access the target bucket no matter whether **Blacklisted Referers** is left blank or not.

   .. note::

      If **Whitelisted Referers** is configured the same as **Blacklisted Referers**, the blacklist takes effect. For example, if both **Whitelisted Referers** and **Blacklisted Referers** are set to **https://www.example.com**, access requests from this address will be blocked.

   -  If **Whitelisted Referers** and **Blacklisted Referers** are both left blank, all websites are allowed to access data in the target bucket by default.
   -  Before determining whether a user has the four types of permissions (read, write, ACL read, and ACL write) for a bucket or objects in the bucket, check whether this user complies with the URL validation principles of the **Referer** field.
