Can I Cancel the Directory Sharing After a Directory Has Been Shared with Others?
=================================================================================

No. URLs for sharing objects or directories through OBS Browser+ have a validity period. During the validity period, the sharing cannot be canceled. Therefore, exercise caution when selecting a URL validity period and when selecting the objects or directories you want to share.
