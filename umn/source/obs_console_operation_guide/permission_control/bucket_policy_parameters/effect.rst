Effect
======

A bucket policy can either allow or deny the access requests that match the configuration.

-  **Allow**: The policy allows the matched requests.
-  **Deny**: The policy denies the matched requests.

When a bucket policy contains both the allow and deny effects, the deny effect prevails. The following figure shows the judgment process.

   **Figure 1** Determining a bucket policy when the allow and deny statements conflict

#. A user initiates an access request.
#. OBS preferentially searches for deny (explicit deny) effects from bucket policies. If a deny statement is found, OBS directly rejects the access. The access request ends.
#. If there is no deny statement, OBS searches for allow statements.

   -  If an allow statement is found, OBS allows the access.
   -  If no allow statement is found, OBS rejects the access. The access request ends.

#. If an error occurs during the judgment, an error message is generated and returned to the user who initiates the access request.
