Task Management
===============

OBS Browser supports the management of upload, download, deletion, and restoration tasks. You can suspend, cancel, or delete tasks using the task management function.

.. note::

   If the number of displayed items exceeds 200,000, the system will save the first 100,000 items of tasks that are created earlier to the **history** directory in the decompression path of OBS Browser. These items are saved in the **historyDBData**\ [*time stamp*]\ **.csv** files, for example, **historyDBData20170426T063744.csv**.
