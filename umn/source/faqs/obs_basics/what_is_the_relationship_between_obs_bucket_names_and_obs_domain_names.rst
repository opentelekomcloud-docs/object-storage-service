What Is the Relationship Between OBS Bucket Names and OBS Domain Names?
=======================================================================

An OBS bucket name is the name of the bucket you created.

The domain name is the endpoint of the region where the bucket is located.

The domain name of your bucket is the bucket name plus the regional domain name (*bucket_name.domain_name*).
