Accessing OBS Using an IAM Agency
=================================

The IAM agency is a function of Identity and Access Management (IAM). In some OBS application scenarios (such as CDN private bucket retrieval and cross-region replication), IAM agencies are required to grant other users or cloud services the permission to access OBS and manage OBS resources for the delegating party, thus implementing secure and efficient agent maintenance.

For details about IAM agencies, see `Identity and Access Management User Guide <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/iam/iam_01_0026.html>`__.
