Will an Object Deletion in a Source Bucket Be Synchronized to the Destination Bucket?
=====================================================================================

If you enable synchronous deletion, deleting an object in a source bucket will synchronously delete its copy in the destination bucket. If you do not enable this function, delete actions in the source bucket do not make object copies in the destination bucket deleted.
