Obtaining Access Keys (AK/SK)
=============================

When you call APIs, you need to use the AK and SK for authentication. To obtain the AK and SK, perform the following steps:

#. Log in to the console.
#. Hover the cursor over the username in the upper right corner and choose **My Credentials** from the drop-down list.
#. On the **My Credentials** page, click **Manage Access Keys**.
#. Click **Add Access Key**.
#. Enter the password for login.
#. Enter the authentication code your email received.
#. Click **OK** to download the access key file.

   .. note::

      Keep AKs and SKs properly to prevent information leakage.
