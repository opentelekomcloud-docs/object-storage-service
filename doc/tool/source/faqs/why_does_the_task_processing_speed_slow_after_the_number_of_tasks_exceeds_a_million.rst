Why Does the Task Processing Speed Slow After the Number of Tasks Exceeds a Million?
====================================================================================

**Cause**

If the number of tasks in OBS Browser+ reaches a million or more, the system will spend more time in searching among massive amounts of tasks, which adds load to your device.

**Solution**

Clear historical tasks to improve performance.

To delete historical tasks, go to the **Task Management** page, select the completed tasks that you no longer need, and delete them, as shown in :ref:`Managing Completed Tasks <obs_03_1072>`.
