#. Log in to the management console.
#. Click the username and choose **My Credential** from the drop-down list.

3. Click **Access Credentials**.
4. Click **Add Access Key** to switch to the **Add Access Key** page.
5. Enter the password used for the current login.
6. Enter the authentication code received in the email or mobile phone.

   .. note::

      -  For users created in Identity and Access Management (IAM), if no email address or mobile phone is filled during the user creation, you only need to authenticate the login password.
      -  For MyWorkplace, users do not need to authenticate the login password. If the email address or mobile phone information is unavailable, you can create an access password without the authentication code.

7. Click **OK** to download the access key.

   .. note::

      To prevent the access key from being leaked, keep it secure.
