Using Postman Collection to Send API Requests
=====================================================================

You can use Postman application to send API requests and get responses from the OBS services. Please find the OBS Postman requests collection file and the Postman environment file attached below:

* :download:`Postman collection file <_static/attachments/OBS_collection.postman_collection.json>`
* :download:`Postman environment file <_static/attachments/Prod_eude.postman_environment.json>`

The files above were tested using Postman application for Windows. These are templates that can be used to check the API call methods in order to help you construct API calls in other tools.

In order to send requests from the collection:

#. Download the OBS Postman requests collection file and the Postman environment file.
#. Import the downloaded files into Postman.
#. In the Environments window: click on the imported Prod_eude environment to set it as active and fill the variables with the required values.
#. In the Collections window: send requests contained in the imported OBS_collection.
