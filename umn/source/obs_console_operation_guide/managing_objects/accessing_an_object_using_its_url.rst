Accessing an Object Using Its URL
=================================

You can grant anonymous users the read permission for an object so they can access the object using the shared object URL.

Prerequisites
-------------

Anonymous users have the read permission for the object. For details about permission granting, see :ref:`Granting Anonymous Users Permission to Access Objects <obs_03_0132>`.

.. note::

   Encrypted objects cannot be shared.

Procedure
---------

#. In the bucket list, click the bucket you want to operate. The **Overview** page is displayed.

#. In the navigation pane, choose **Objects**.

#. Click the object to be shared. The object information is displayed on the top part of the page. You can find the link for accessing the object in the **Link** area, as shown in :ref:`Figure 1 <obs_03_0319__fig36534596192426>`.

   Anonymous users can access the object by clicking this link. An object link (URL) is in the format of **https://**\ *Bucket name*.\ *Domain name*/*Directory level*/*Object name*. If the object is stored in the root directory of the bucket, its URL does not contain any directory level.
