Can I Install Two OBS Browser+ Tools from Different Sites in One System?
========================================================================

No.

-  You can install only one OBS Browser+ tool in a system.
-  OBS Browser+ tools available at different sites provide different functions.

Therefore, if you want to use OBS at a site, download the OBS Browser+ tool of the site.
