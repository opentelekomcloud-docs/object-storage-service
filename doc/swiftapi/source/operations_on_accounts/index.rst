Operations on Accounts
======================

The requests that are sent by users to OBS (compatible with OpenStack Swift) must comply with REST specifications and contain required header parameters. If a request is successfully processed, OBS (compatible with OpenStack Swift) returns a success response. If the request cannot be processed, OBS (compatible with OpenStack Swift) returns a message that contains the cause of the error. This chapter describes REST operations for accounts with IAM authentication.
