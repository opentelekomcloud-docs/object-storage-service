+OBS provides the following storage classes for buckets: Standard, Warm, and Cold. With support for these storage classes, OBS caters to diverse storage performance and cost requirements. When creating a bucket, you can specify a storage class for it, which can be changed later.
 
 Each bucket name in OBS is globally unique and cannot be changed after the bucket has been created. The region where a bucket resides cannot be changed once the bucket is created. When you create a bucket, OBS creates a default access control list (ACL) that grants users permissions (such as read and write permissions) on the bucket. Only authorized users can perform operations such as creating, deleting, viewing, and configuring buckets.
