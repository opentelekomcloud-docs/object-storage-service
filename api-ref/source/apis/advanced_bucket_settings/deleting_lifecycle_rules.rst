Deleting Lifecycle Rules
========================

Functions
---------

This operation deletes the lifecycle configuration of a bucket. After the lifecycle configuration of a bucket is deleted, OBS will not automatically delete objects in that bucket.

To perform this operation, you must have the **PutLifecycleConfiguration** permission. By default, only the bucket owner can perform this operation. The bucket owner can grant the permission to other users by configuring the bucket policy or user policy.
