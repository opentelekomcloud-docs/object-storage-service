Overview
========

A bucket owner can configure a bucket policy to manage access to the bucket.

Bucket policies centrally control access to buckets and objects based on a variety of request elements, such as actions, principals, resources, and others (like IP addresses). If the resource is set to **\***, the permission applies to all objects in a bucket. For example, an account can create a policy to:

-  Grant users the write permission for a specific bucket.
-  Grant users in a specific network the write permission.
