+   After HTTPS and KMS encryption are enabled, objects uploaded to OBS are encrypted with keys provided by KMS. By default, the key **obs/default** is used for encryption.
 
    After objects are uploaded, click |image2| on the right of the object list. In the **Properties** dialog box that is displayed, you can view the object encryption status. **Yes** indicates that server-side encryption has been implemented for the object. **No** indicates that server-side encryption has not been implemented for the object. The object encryption status cannot be changed.
