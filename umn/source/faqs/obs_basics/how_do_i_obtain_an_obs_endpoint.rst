How Do I Obtain an OBS Endpoint?
================================

You can access OBS through domain names. When you are using the API, third-party tools, or other methods to access OBS, you can use domain names to conveniently locate resources in OBS.

Before using OBS, ensure that the DNS server address has been correctly configured on the client.

Each data center has its own domain name. For details about domain names, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/endpoint/index.html>`__.
