Accessing OBS Using an IAM Agency
=================================

The IAM agency is a function of Identity and Access Management (IAM). In scenarios such as CDN private bucket retrieval and cross-region replication, IAM agencies are required to grant other users or cloud services the permissions to access and to securely and efficiently manage OBS resources.

For details about IAM agencies, see `Identity and Access Management User Guide <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/iam/iam_01_0026.html>`__.
