Where Can I Obtain Access Keys (AK and SK)?
===========================================

When using OBS Browser+ to access OBS, you need to use the AK and SK for authentication. To obtain the AK and SK, perform the following steps:

#. Log in to the console.
#. Click the login username in the upper right corner and choose **My Credentials** from the drop-down list.
#. Choose **Access Keys**.
#. Click **Create Access Key**.
#. Enter an access key description (optional) and click **OK**.
#. Enter the verification code sent to your mobile phone, virtual MFA device, or email, and click **OK**.

   .. note::

      This step is required only when you have enabled operation protection.

#. Click **Download** to obtain the access key file.

   .. note::

      Keep AKs and SKs properly to prevent information leakage.
