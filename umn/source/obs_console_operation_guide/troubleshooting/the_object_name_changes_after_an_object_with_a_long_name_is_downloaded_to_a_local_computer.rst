The Object Name Changes After an Object with a Long Name Is Downloaded to a Local Computer
==========================================================================================

Question
--------

After an object with a relatively long name is downloaded to a local path, the object name changes.

Answer
------

For Windows, a file name, including the file name extension, can contain a maximum of 255 characters. When an object with a name containing more than 255 characters is downloaded to a local computer, the system keeps only the first 255 characters automatically.
