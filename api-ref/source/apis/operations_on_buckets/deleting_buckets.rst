Deleting Buckets
================

Functions
---------

This operation deletes specified buckets. This operation can be performed only by the bucket owner and users who have been authorized (via a policy) with the permission to delete the bucket. The bucket to be deleted must be an empty bucket. If a bucket has an object or a multipart task, the bucket is not empty. You can list objects and multipart upload tasks in a bucket to check whether the bucket is empty.

Note:

If the server returns a **5XX** error or times out when a bucket is being deleted, the system needs to synchronize the bucket information. During this period, the bucket information may be inaccurate. Therefore, wait a while and then check whether the bucket is successfully deleted. If the bucket can still be queried, send the deletion request again.
