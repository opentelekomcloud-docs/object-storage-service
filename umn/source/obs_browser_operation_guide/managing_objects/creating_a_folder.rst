Creating a Folder
=================

This section describes how to create a folder using OBS Browser.

Background Information
----------------------

Unlike the file system, OBS does not involve the concepts of file and folder. For easy data management, OBS provides a method to simulate folders. On OBS, an object is simulated as a folder by adding a slash (/) to the object name on OBS Browser.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to OBS Browser.
#. Click the bucket in which you want to create a folder. Click **Create Folder**.
#. In the dialog box that is displayed, enter a folder name and click **OK**.

   -  You can create single-level or multi-level folders.
   -  The name cannot contain the following special characters: ``\:*?"<>|``
   -  The name cannot start or end with a period (.) or slash (/).
   -  The folder's absolute path cannot exceed 1,023 characters.
   -  Any single slash (/) separates and creates multiple levels of folders at once.
   -  The name cannot contain two or more consecutive slashes (/).

#. In the dialog box that is displayed, click **OK**.
