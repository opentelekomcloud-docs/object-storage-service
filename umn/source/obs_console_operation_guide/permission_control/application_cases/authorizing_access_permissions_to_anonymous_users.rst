Authorizing Access Permissions to Anonymous Users
=================================================

An enterprise stores a large volume of map data in OBS, and offers the data for public query. This enterprise sets a read permission for anonymous users, and provides the data URLs on the Internet. Then all users can read or download the data through the URLs.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to OBS Console and click **Create Bucket** to create a bucket.

#. In the bucket list, click the name of the newly created bucket. On the page that is displayed, click **Objects** in the pane on the left, and upload the map data as an object to the new bucket.

#. Click the object to be operated and click **Object ACL**.

#. In **Object ACL** > **Public Permissions** > **Anonymous User**, click **Edit** to set **Access to Object** to **Read**. For details, see :ref:`Figure 1 <obs_03_0132__fig58496641194012>`.
