Endpoints
=========

An endpoint is the **request address** for calling an API. Endpoints vary depending on services and regions. For the endpoints of services, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/endpoint/index.html>`__.

OBS provides a second-level domain name for each region. You can use the domain name provided by OBS or a custom domain name to access OBS.
