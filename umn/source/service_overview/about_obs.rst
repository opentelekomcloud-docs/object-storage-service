About OBS
=========

Object Storage Service (OBS) is a scalable service that provides secure, reliable, and cost-effective cloud storage for massive amounts of data. On OBS, you can easily manage your OBS resources, such as creating, modifying, and deleting buckets, or uploading, downloading, and deleting objects.

OBS provides unlimited storage capacity for objects of any format, catering to the needs of common users, websites, enterprises, and developers. There is no limitation on the storage capacity of the entire OBS system or of a single bucket, and any number of objects can be stored. As a web service, OBS supports APIs over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). You can use OBS Console or OBS Browser+ to access and manage data stored in OBS anytime, anywhere. OBS supports SDKs and is compatible with the REST APIs of Amazon S3. With the SDKs and APIs, you can easily manage data stored in OBS and develop upper-layer applications. OBS Console and OBS Browser are only compatible with the Amazon S3 APIs.

Cloud service infrastructures can be deployed in multiple regions, delivering high scalability and reliability. You can deploy OBS in specific regions for faster access at an affordable price.
