Managing Fragments
==================

Background Information
----------------------

Data can be uploaded to OBS using multipart uploads. Fragments are generated, if a multipart upload fails because of the following reasons (included but not limited to):

-  The network is in poor conditions, and the connection to the OBS server is interrupted frequently.
-  The upload task is manually suspended.
-  The device is faulty.
-  The device is powered off suddenly.

On OBS Console, storage used by fragments is charged. Clear fragments when they are not needed. If a file upload task fails, upload the file again.

.. important::

   Fragments on OBS consume storage spaces that are charged according to price rates of storage space.
