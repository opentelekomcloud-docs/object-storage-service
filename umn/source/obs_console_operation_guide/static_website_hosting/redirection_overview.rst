Redirection Overview
====================

When using static website hosting, you can also configure redirection to redirect specific or all requests.

If the structure, address, or file name extension of a website is changed, users will fail to access the website using the old address (such as the address saved in the folder of favorites), and the 404 error message is returned. In this case, you can configure redirection for the website to redirect user access requests to the specified page instead of returning the 404 error page.

Typical configurations include:

-  Redirecting all requests to another website.
-  Redirecting specific requests based on redirection rules.
