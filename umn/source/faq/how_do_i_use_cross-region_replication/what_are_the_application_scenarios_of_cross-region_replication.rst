What Are the Application Scenarios of Cross-Region Replication?
===============================================================

-  The same OBS resources need to be accessed in different locations. To minimize the access latency, you can use cross-region replication to create object copies in the nearest region.
-  Due to business reasons, you need to migrate OBS data to the data center in another region.
-  To ensure data security and availability, you need to create explicit backups for all data written to OBS in the data center of another region. Therefore, secure backup data is available if the source data is damaged irrevocably.
