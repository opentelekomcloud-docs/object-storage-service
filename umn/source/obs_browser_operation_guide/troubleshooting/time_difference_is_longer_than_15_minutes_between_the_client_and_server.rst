Time Difference Is Longer Than 15 Minutes Between the Client and Server
=======================================================================

Question
--------

OBS is unavailable when an error is reported stating that the time difference between the client and server is larger than 15 minutes.

Answer
------

For security purposes, OBS checks the time difference between OBS Browser and the server. If the time difference is larger than 15 minutes, this error will be reported. To fix this error, adjust the local time based on the UTC time.
