Deleting a File or Folder
=========================

This section describes how to delete a file or folder.

Background Information
----------------------

Deleting a folder will delete all files in the folder. Ensure that all files in a folder can be deleted before deleting the folder.

Deleting unnecessary files or folders saves space and costs.

You can use the lifecycle management function to implement periodic deletion of unneeded files or batch delete all files or folders in OBS. For details, see :ref:`Lifecycle Management Overview <obs_03_0425>`.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to OBS Browser.

#. Select the object that you want to delete and choose **More** > **Delete** on the right.

   OBS Browser supports batch deletion. You can select multiple files or folders and click **Delete** above the list to delete them in batches.

#. In the displayed dialog box, click **Yes**.
