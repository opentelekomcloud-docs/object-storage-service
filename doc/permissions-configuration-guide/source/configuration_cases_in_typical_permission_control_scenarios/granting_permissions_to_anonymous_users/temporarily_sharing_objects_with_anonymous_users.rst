Temporarily Sharing Objects with Anonymous Users
================================================

Scenario
--------

If you want to open an object to all users for a limited period of time, you can use the object sharing function.

Procedure for Sharing a File
----------------------------

#. In the navigation pane of OBS Console, choose **Object Storage**.

#. In the bucket list, click the bucket name you want to go to the **Overview** page.

#. In the navigation pane, click **Objects**.

#. Locate the file to be shared and click **Share** in the **Operation** column.

   Once the **Share File** dialog box is opened, the URL is effective and valid for five minutes by default. If you change the validity period, the authentication information in the URL changes accordingly, and the URL's new validity period starts upon the change.

#. Perform URL related operations.

   -  Click **Open URL** to preview the file on a new page or directly download it to your default download path.
   -  Click **Copy Link** to share the link to other users, so that they can enter the link to a web browser to access the file.
   -  Click **Copy Path** to share the file path to users who have access permissions to the bucket. Then the users can search for the file by pasting the path to the search box of the bucket.

   .. note::

      Within the validity period of a URL, any user who has the URL can access the file.
