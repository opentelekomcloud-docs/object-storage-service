Application Scenarios
=====================

-  OBS is built for you to store and retrieve any amount of data anytime, anywhere. It is a good data storage choice for mobile, web, and application developers. OBS also reduces costs in nearline and offline storage, such as backup, big data storage, and archiving.
-  OBS is linearly scalable, cost effective (no initial investment and more savings with more use), highly reliable, and secure (end-to-end security for access, transfer, and storage). Thanks to its scalability, as businesses continue to grow, developers can focus on business innovations, instead of underlying storage technologies. Most importantly, this greatly reduces IT costs.

OBS can be used for video surveillance, video on demand (VOD), backup and archive, high-performance computing (HPC), mobile Internet, enterprise cloud boxes (web disks), and many other scenarios.
