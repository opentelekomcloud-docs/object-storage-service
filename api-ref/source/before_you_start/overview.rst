Overview
========

Welcome to the *Object Storage Service API Reference*. Object Storage Service (OBS) provides massive, secure, reliable, and cost-effective data storage capabilities for users to store data of any type and size. It is suitable for scenarios such as enterprise backup/archiving, video on demand (VoD), and video surveillance.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on OBS, such as creating, modifying, and deleting bucket, as well as uploading, downloading, and deleting objects. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <obs_04_0005>`.

Before calling OBS APIs, ensure that you have fully understood relevant concepts. For details, see :ref:`Basic Concepts <obs_04_0004>`.
