Drag-and-Drop Upload
====================

OBS Browser+ supports upload by drag and drop. You can drag one or more files or folders from a local path and drop them to the object list or file list. You can even drag files or folders directly to a specified folder. Drag-and-drop upload helps you easily upload local files to OBS.
