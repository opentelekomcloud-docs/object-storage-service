Parallel File System
====================

Parallel File System (PFS) is a high-performance semantic file system provided by OBS. It features access latency in milliseconds, TB/s-level bandwidth, and millions of IOPS, which makes it ideal for processing high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.

For details about PFS, see the `Parallel File System Feature Guide <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/object-storage-service/parallel-file-system/>`__.
