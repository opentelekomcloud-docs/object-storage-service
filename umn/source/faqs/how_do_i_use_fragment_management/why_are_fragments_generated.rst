Why Are Fragments Generated?
============================

Fragments are incomplete data in buckets generated due to data upload failures.

Data can be uploaded to OBS using multipart uploads. Fragments are generated, if a multipart upload fails because of the following reasons (included but not limited to):

-  The network is in poor conditions, and the connection to the OBS server is interrupted frequently.
-  The upload task is manually suspended.
-  The device is faulty.
-  The device is powered off suddenly.
