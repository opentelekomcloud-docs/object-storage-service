How Is Data Security Ensured in OBS?
====================================

OBS is secure. It provides end-to-end security services. For example, if a bucket or an object is undisclosed when you access the bucket or object, only the owner of the bucket or object can access it. Further, the access to the bucket or object requires access keys (AK/SK). You can also use various access control mechanisms (such as bucket policies and ACLs) to select users and user groups and grant them permissions. OBS supports data transfer over the HTTPS/SSL protocol. Data encryption prior to upload is available to meet your higher security requirements.
