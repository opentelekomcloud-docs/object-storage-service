Can I Recover a Deleted Object?
===============================

After versioning is enabled, if you delete an object without specifying a version ID, the object is tagged with a **Delete Marker** and displayed in the list of **Deleted Objects**. You can recover the object from that list.

If versioning is not enabled or an object is deleted with its version ID specified after the function is enabled, OBS will delete the object, and you cannot recover it.

For details, see :ref:`Versioning Overview <en-us_topic_0045853504>`.
