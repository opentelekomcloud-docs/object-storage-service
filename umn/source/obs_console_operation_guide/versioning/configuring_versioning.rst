Related Operations
------------------

After versioning is enabled for a bucket, you can extend the retention period of a WORM-protected object version, as well as delete, share, and download object versions.

#. In the bucket list, click the bucket you want to operate to go to the **Objects** page.
#. Above the search box, enable **Historical Versions** to view different versions of objects.
#. Perform the following operations on object versions:

   a. Download a desired version of the object by clicking **Download** in the **Operation** column.

      .. note::

         If the version you want to download is in the Cold storage class, restore it first.

   b. Share a version of the object by clicking **Share** in the **Operation** column.
   c. Permanently delete a version of the object by choosing **More** > **Permanently** **Delete** in the **Operation** column. The deleted object version cannot be recovered. If you delete the latest version, the most recent version will become the latest version.

      .. note::

         In a WORM-enabled bucket, if an object has no retention policy configured or its retention policy has expired, you can delete a desired object version on the object list page. If the object version is within the retention period, it cannot be deleted.

   d. Locate the object version for which you want to extend the retention period, choose **More** > **Extend Retention Period**, and select a date. A retention period can be extended, but cannot be shortened.
