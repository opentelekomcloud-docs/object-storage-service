Does OBS Browser+ Support the Migration of Account and Task Information From OBS Browser?
=========================================================================================

OBS Browser+ can migrate only the account information kept by OBS Browser, but not the task information. You can migrate such information only once, therefore, you are advised to stick to OBS Browser+ once you start to use it.
