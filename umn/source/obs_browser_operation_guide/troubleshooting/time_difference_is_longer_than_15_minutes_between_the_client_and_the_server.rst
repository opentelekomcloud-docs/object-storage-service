Time Difference Is Longer Than 15 Minutes Between the Client and the Server
===========================================================================

Question
--------

OBS is unavailable when an error is reported stating "Time difference is longer than 15 minutes between the client and server."

Answer
------

For security purposes, OBS checks the time difference between OBS Browser and the server. If the time difference is greater than 15 minutes, this error is reported. Adjust the local time based on the UTC time to avoid this problem.
