Can I Search for a Bucket by Tag?
=================================

Searching for buckets by tag is not supported by OBS. However, you can use Tag Management Service (TMS) to search for buckets by tag. For details, see `Searching for Cloud Resources <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/usermanual/tms/en-us_topic_0056266264.html>`__. **Resource Type** should be set to **OBS-Bucket**.
