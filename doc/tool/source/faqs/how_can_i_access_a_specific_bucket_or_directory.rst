How Can I Access a Specific Bucket or Directory?
================================================

In some scenarios, when you try to log in to OBS Browser+ using access keys (AK and SK) that have only the permission to access a specific bucket or a specific directory in a bucket, the login will fail because of the lack of listing and other permissions.
