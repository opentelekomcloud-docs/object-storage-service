What Is the Relationship Between Bucket Storage Classes and Object Storage Classes?
===================================================================================

When an object is uploaded, it inherits the storage class of the bucket by default, but you can change the storage class when you upload the object.

Changing the storage class of a bucket does not change the storage class of existing objects in the bucket. However, any new objects uploaded to the bucket will inherit the bucket's new storage class.
