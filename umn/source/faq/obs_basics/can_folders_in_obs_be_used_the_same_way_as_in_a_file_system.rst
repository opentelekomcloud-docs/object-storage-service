Can Folders in OBS Be Used the Same Way as in a File System?
============================================================

No.

OBS does not involve files or folders like in a file system. For your convenience, OBS provides a way to simulate folders. On OBS Console, you can simulate a folder by adding a slash (/) to the name of an object, which is then displayed as a folder.
