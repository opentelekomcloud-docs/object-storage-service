Searching for a Bucket
======================

This section describes how to search for a bucket by entering characters contained in its name on OBS Browser.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to OBS Browser.

#. In the search box in the upper right corner on the main page, enter characters contained in the name of the desired bucket.

#. Click |image1|.

   The found buckets are displayed in the bucket list. If you want to search for other buckets, click |image2| in the search box to delete the keyword you have entered and enter a new one.

   If you want to leave the object list page and quickly switch to another bucket, you can click |image3| on the left side to expand the hidden bucket list and search for the desired bucket in the search box above the bucket list.

   For example, if you want to search for buckets whose names contain **test**, you only need to enter **test** in the search box in the upper right corner on the main page and click |image4|. Then, all buckets that contain **test** in their names are displayed in the bucket list.
