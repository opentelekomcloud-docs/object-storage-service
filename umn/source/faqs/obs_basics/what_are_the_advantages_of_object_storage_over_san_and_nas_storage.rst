What Are the Advantages of Object Storage over SAN and NAS Storage?
===================================================================

-  SAN storage provides LUNs or volumes for applications. LUNs and volumes are forms of disk storage. Upper-layer applications use Fibre Channel or iSCSI protocols to access SAN storage. SAN storage focuses on disk management. For other purposes, SAN storage must rely on upper-layer applications.
-  NAS storage provides file systems or folders for applications. Upper-layer applications use NFS or CIFS protocols to access NAS storage. Directory trees of file systems must be maintained.
-  Object storage is suitable for web applications. A massive bucket storage space is provided based on a URL address to store a wide range of file objects. Object storage adopts a flat architecture. Users do not need to maintain complex file directories. There is no need to worry about running out of storage because the storage a bucket can provide is practically unlimited.
