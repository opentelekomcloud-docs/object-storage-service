===========================================================================================================================================================

Question
--------

When starting OBS Browser on a Windows OS, an error occurs with the message displays as "The task management function cannot work properly because the database is unavailable. Shut down OBS Browser, delete all files in the obs folder in the database path (check the path at System Configuration > Other), and restart OBS Browser." But the problem cannot be resolved by deleting the obs folder.

Log in to Windows OS using a user whose name contains only digits and letters (either uppercase or lowercase, or both), and then start OBS Browser.
