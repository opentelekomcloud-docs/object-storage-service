Tag Overview
============

Tags are used to identify and classify OBS buckets.

If you add tags to a bucket, service detail records (SDRs) generated for it will be labeled with these tags. You can classify SDRs by tag for cost analysis. For example, if you have an application that uploads its running data to a bucket, you can tag the bucket with the application name. In this manner, the costs on the application can be analyzed using tags in SDRs.

A tag is described using a key-value pair. A bucket can have a maximum of 20 tags. Each tag has only one key and one value.

The key and value can exist in either sequence in a tag. Each key is unique among all tags of a bucket, whereas values can be repetitive or blank.
