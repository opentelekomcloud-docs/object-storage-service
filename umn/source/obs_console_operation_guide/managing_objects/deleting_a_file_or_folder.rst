Deleting a File or Folder
=========================

Scenarios
---------

On OBS Console, you can manually delete unneeded files or folders to release space and reduce costs.

Alternatively, you can configure lifecycle rules to periodically, automatically delete some or all of the files and folders from a bucket. For details, see :ref:`Configuring a Lifecycle Rule <obs_03_0335>`.

Background Information
----------------------

**Object Deletion with Versioning Enabled**

When versioning is enabled for a bucket, OBS works slightly different when deleting different objects.

-  Deleting a file or folder: The file or folder is not permanently deleted, but is retained in the **Deleted Objects** list and marked with the **Delete Marker**. In **Deleted Objects**, click the object name. On the **Versions** tab, you can see that the latest object version has the delete marker.

   -  To permanently delete the file or folder, delete it again from the **Deleted Objects** list. For details, see :ref:`Procedure <en-us_topic_0045853756__section56466209>`.
   -  To recover the deleted file, undelete it from the **Deleted Objects** list. For details, see :ref:`Undeleting a File <en-us_topic_0066176932>`.

-  Deleting an object version: The version will be permanently deleted. If the deleted version is the latest one, the next latest version becomes the latest version.

Related Operations
------------------

When versioning is enabled, files in the **Deleted Objects** list also have multiple versions. Note the following points when deleting different versions of files:

-  Deleting a version with the **Delete Marker** actually recovers this version instead of permanently deleting it. For details, see :ref:`Undeleting a File <en-us_topic_0066176932>`.
-  Deleting a version without the **Delete Marker** permanently deletes this version. This version will not be recovered even if the object is recovered later.
