How Is Data Security Ensured in OBS?
====================================

OBS is secure. It provides end-to-end security services. For example, if a bucket or an object is undisclosed when you access the bucket or object, only the owner of the bucket or object can access it. Further, the access to the bucket or object requires access keys (AK/SK). You can also use various access control mechanisms (such as bucket policies and ACLs) to select users and user groups and grant them permissions. During data transmission, OBS supports HTTPS and SSL. If you require stronger security, enable server-side encryption.
